This is Data analysis on stock prices of Amazon and Google from 2019 to 2024.
This contains explanation of how I have interpreted the data. Which answers Key questions:
1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?
2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?
3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks'?
5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

I have used yfinance library to collect data. 

I have applied Linear Regression on the very same Amazon data I collected, which is in the Regression Repository.
